# Benedikt Wiesner - Google Cyber Security Portfolio Notes & Resources

This repo contains my personal notes and key takeaways from the **Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate**, completed via Coursera.

The goal was to refresh my existing knowledge in cybersecurity concepts, tools, and job-ready skills. I’ve documented the major topics from each course, summarized key concepts, and included hands-on exercises where possible.
